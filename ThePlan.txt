            - Suspense Date : 29 Jan 2021
            - Priority : High
            - Predicted Workload : 18
            - Tasker Description : 
            You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commanders. I'm here to put you back on schedule. Your people are not working fast enough, perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them? The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation; he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress. For your sake, I hope you are able to get this project back on track. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.

                This is an unclassified system, I would recommend we move discussion and dissemination to a TS system. Please see attachments for details.

    That covers our application.
    Did build the infrastructure to incorperate some additional features that we would incorperate given additional time
        - Routing : taskers would go through the appropriate chain for approval/routing
        - Email Notifications : Recieve emails when you get updates
        - User Permissions : Not everyone can send/reply/edit taskers
            - Direct taskers to the Big bigCheese
    Thank you for your time again and with that we will open it up for any questions
